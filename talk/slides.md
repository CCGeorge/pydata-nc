### Your data
- Be as accurate as possible

<div class="bk-root">
<div class="plotdiv" id="f3184bde-66b5-41c9-92a0-b6a6fd0847de"></div></div>

<div class="bk-root">
<div class="plotdiv" id="d15e01a7-caa3-4a82-a924-d872544e04f9"></div></div>

Then you get the data....

* Viz doesn't work
 * over/under plotting
 * no / too much variation

* You don't have the message you thought you did

* Wasted time

Note:
- spark lines
- story wasn't what was expected
- accomodated problems that weren't there

## Use the real data

### Hopefully not a problem for this crowd

## Telling

* Prompt your audience to what they're looking at/for

> "Don't overestimate the public's knowledge. Never underestimate the public's intelligence." <br/>
<small>Gorham Munsen, The Written Word (1949)</small>

> "Assume an intelligent, impatient reader." <br/>

## At the least

Don't expect someone to understand your spreadsheet:

* Break it out
* Label your axes
* Give the chart a title 
* Write an explanation

Note:
- pick the right viz
- explain the viz
- explain / show your working
- highlight your message


raw analysis < explanation ~ summary visualization < summary visualization with explanation

# Exploratory

## SHOW AND TELL

* You have a message to tell
* Showing lets the reader "know" it for themselves
 - takes them on your journey
 - compell them with your evidence

### What is your message?

### What is your message?

<small>The retina is the most accessible element of the central nervous system for linking behavior to the activity of isolated neurons. We unraveled behavior at the elementary level of single input units—the visual sensation generated by stimulating individual long (L), middle (M), and short (S) wavelength–sensitive cones with light. Spectrally identified cones near the fovea of human observers were targeted with small spots of light, and the type, proportion, and repeatability of the elicited sensations were recorded.Two distinct populations of cones were observed: a smaller group predominantly associated with signaling chromatic sensations and a second, more numerous population linked to achromatic percepts  Red and green sensations were mainly driven by L- and M-cones, respectively, although both cone types elicited achromatic percepts. Sensations generated by cones were rarely stochastic; rather, they were consistent over many months and were dominated by one specific perceptual category. Cones lying in the midst of a pure spectrally opponent neighborhood, an arrangement purported to be most efficient in producing chromatic signals in downstream neurons, were no more likely to signal chromatic percepts. Overall, the results are consistent with the idea that the nervous system encodes high-resolution achromatic information and lower-resolution color signals in separate pathways that emerge as early as the first synapse. The lower proportion of cones eliciting color sensations may reflect a lack of evolutionary pressure for the chromatic system to be as fine-grained as the high-acuity achromatic system.</small>

## Why?

--

Who?

* Report for colleagues
* Informing / influencing decisions 
* Client-facing
* Public facing


Note:

 - known and near
 - succinct messaging
 - future users
 - unknown users
 - any user

<h4 class="slide-title">Telling your data story</h4>
### Your data
* Be as accurate as possible
* Use your data to design

### Story
* Message - what, why, who?
* Craft a narrative

### Telling
* Assume an intelligent, impatient reader
* Highlight illustrative examples
* Document how to use


Note:

Message
- Write it out in plain english (plain english - visual communication is a common language)


Why Bokeh?
- a tool that can be used practically for exploration and analysis
- but leveraged for explanation
    

People don't want/need all the flashy interactions?
- but you can use interaction to support your case

Dashboards
- difficult middle ground between exploratory and explanatory
